[mod-setting-description]
SubtleMapTileColors-brightness=Adjusts brightness of terrain map colors.\n0: Black, 50: Darker, 100: Normal, 150: Lighter, 200: White
SubtleMapTileColors-saturation=Adjusts saturation of terrain map colors.\nReducing saturation may make other items stand out more on the map.  0: Greyscale,  100: Normal,  200: Vivid

SubtleMapTileColors-mincolor=The color to use for the slowest tiles.\n\nAccepted formats include HTML-like color codes (e.g. #abc or #aabbcc) or a list of three numbers (e.g. 100 150 200 or 0.4, 0.5, 0.6).
SubtleMapTileColors-maxcolor=The color to use for the fastest tiles.\n\nAccepted formats include HTML-like color codes (e.g. #abc or #aabbcc) or a list of three numbers (e.g. 100 150 200 or 0.4, 0.5, 0.6).
SubtleMapTileColors-basecolor=The color to use for tiles with no movement speed adjustment.\n\nAccepted formats include HTML-like color codes (e.g. #abc or #aabbcc) or a list of three numbers (e.g. 100 150 200 or 0.4, 0.5, 0.6).
SubtleMapTileColors-minspeed=The slowest tile speed.  All tiles defining a speed of this amount or lower will be in the slow tile color.  Tiles between this speed and 100% will be a blend between the two colors.\n\n0 = automatically choose the slowest tile speed in prototypes.
SubtleMapTileColors-maxspeed=The fastest file speed.  All tiles defining a speed of this amount or more will be in the fast tile color.  Tiles between 100% and this speed will be a blend between the two colors.\n\n0 = automatically choose the fastest tile speed in prototypes.\n\nValues less than 100 are treated as 0.

SubtleMapTileColors-use-speed=Whether to recolor tiles based on their movement speed adjustment.\n\nIf disabled, only the brightness and saturation options will have any effect.


BlueprintExtensions_cardinal-center=ON: Snapping to an edge centers the blueprint on the opposite axis.\nOFF: Snapping to an edge does not move the blueprint on the opposite axis.\n\nSetting this to OFF means that snapping to North + snapping to East is the same effect as snapping to Northeast, useful if you have limited keybind space (e.g. no numpad).
BlueprintExtensions_horizontal-invert=Snap to East/West moves that edge of the blueprint to under the cursor rather than aligning the blueprint to that edge.
BlueprintExtensions_vertical-invert=Snap to North/South moves that edge of the blueprint to under the cursor rather than aligning the blueprint to that edge.
BlueprintExtensions_version-increment=Blueprint Extensions can add a version number to blueprints it updates.\n\nOFF: Blueprint labels are always copied as-is.\n\nIF PRESENT: A blueprint label ending in "v.###" or "v###" will have the version number incremented.\n\nALWAYS: Like IF PRESENT, but "v.2" will be added to blueprint labels if no version number is present.\n\nThis setting only applies when using regular mouse drag to select the new blueprint area.
BlueprintExtensions_alt-version-increment=Blueprint Extensions can add a version number to blueprints it updates.\n\nOFF: Blueprint labels are always copied as-is.\n\nIF PRESENT: A blueprint label ending in "v.###" or "v###" will have the version number incremented.\n\nALWAYS: Like IF PRESENT, but "v.2" will be added to blueprint labels if no version number is present.\n\nThis setting applies when using SHIFT + drag to select the new blueprint area.
BlueprintExtensions_show-buttons=Show GUI buttons for flipping blueprints.  If disabled, blueprints can only be flipped by using the hotkey.\n\nThis setting is ignored if Blueprint Flipper and Turner is installed.
BlueprintExtensions_support-gdiw='Gah! DarnItWater!' is a mod that adds mirrored versions of recipes with fluid inputs/outputs.  If this is enabled and GDIW is present, recipes in blueprints will be mirrored when the blueprint itself is mirrored.
BlueprintExtensions_landfill-mode=UPDATE IN-PLACE: Adds landfill to the current blueprint.  The resulting changes cannot be undone.\n\nMAKE A COPY: Creates an identical copy of the current blueprint with landfill added.  Changes can be undone by switching to the original blueprint.\n\nMAKE A TEMPORARY COPY: The copy is deleted when cleared from the cursor.  Temporary copies can be made permanent by manually dropping them in an inventory or the blueprint library.
